// # Welcome!
//
// I am pleased to welcome you to the Test-Driven Development in C++ course.
//
// In this course, we will dive deep into Test-Driven Development (TDD) in C++.
// We will learn how the Red-Green-Refactor cycle works, how to write effective
// and maintainable tests, and how TDD helps us create better software
// designs—building on your knowledge of Clean Code and Clean Architecture.
//
// The course consists of video material, workshops, and live sessions. At the
// beginning of each week, you will receive videos here on Memberspot that cover
// the course content. Many of the videos are accompanied by workshops that you
// should complete independently throughout the week. Here, you can practice and
// deepen the techniques discussed in the videos.
//
// Every Friday, we meet for a two-hour live session to discuss the week's
// content. Here you can ask questions, discuss further topics, and we can do
// live coding together, among other activities.
//
// ### Recommended Videos from the Intro Section
//
// - 02 Welcome to TDD in C++
// - 03 Course Files
// - 04 Development Environments
// - 08 Docker Intro
// - 09 Docker for Notebooks
// - 12 Working with Notebooks
// - 13 Tips for Blended learning
//
// Choose the additional videos according to the development environment you want to use.
//
// ### Course Materials
//
// All course materials can be found in the associated [GitHub
// Repository](https://github.com/Coding-Academy-Munich/cpp-tdd-en). If you are
// familiar with Git, the best way to work with the materials is to clone the
// repository. If you are not familiar with Git, you can download the repository
// content as a zip file by either going to the Repository Home Page, clicking
// the green "<> Code" button, and selecting "Download ZIP", or by clicking
// [this
// link](https://github.com/Coding-Academy-Munich/cpp-tdd-en/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
// However, I will likely update the slides multiple times during the course; to
// receive these updates, you will need to re-download the ZIP archive after
// each update.
//
// ### Jupyter Notebooks
//
// We use Jupyter Notebooks for the course slides. These notebooks allow for the
// interactive execution of code directly from the slides. All notebooks for the
// course are included in the course materials. In the intro section, you will
// find videos explaining how to run the notebooks on your computer using a
// Docker image. Each notebook is available in two versions: as completed slides
// containing all code and solutions to all tasks, and as code-alongs, where
// parts of the source code and solutions are missing. I use the code-alongs in
// the videos, and you are welcome to use these notebooks if you want to follow
// along with the live coding parts of the videos (which I highly recommend).
// The notebooks are in the "Notebooks" folder within the course materials, with
// slides and code-alongs in subfolders.
//
// If you only want to view the slides without participating in live coding,
// there is also an HTML version available. This can be found in the Html
// folder, also with subfolders CodeAlong and Slides.
//
// I wish you a lot of fun and success in the course!
//
// Matthias Hölzl
